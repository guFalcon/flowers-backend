description: Every code change (backend and frontend) goes through the OpenSpec workflow — start with opsx:propose, never patch directly
metadata:
  type: feedback
---

Code changes — backend and frontend alike — are only made inside an OpenSpec change
(`/opsx:propose`, then `/opsx:apply`, `/opsx:verify`, `/opsx:archive`). Do not edit source
directly, not even for an obvious one-line bugfix.

**Why:** Gerald (presserl): "wir machen KEINE Changes außerhalb des Contextes eines opsx:propose. Wir
wollen die openspec-Spec nicht umgehen." The `openspec/` specs are the source of truth for
what the system does; a direct patch leaves the spec silently out of date.

**How to apply:**
- Announce the intent first ([[feedback_announce_changes_first]]), then `/opsx:propose` so
  proposal, design, delta spec and tasks exist before any file is touched.
- Implementation runs via the `/opsx:apply` skill — working `tasks.md` by hand as a plain
  checklist does not count.
- Amend specs by proposing, not inline: a new field or behaviour that the delta spec lacks is
  a change of its own. Ticking `tasks.md` checkboxes and adding findings files is fine.
- The single spec tree lives in this backend repo and also covers `flowers-frontend`
  ([[project_flowers]]); a contract change covers both repos ([[feedback_contract_both_repos]]).
- This includes docs, README, CI and project config: Gerald (presserl, 2026-09-26): "Alles wird bei
  uns über openspec abgewickelt." Memory files are the only exception.
- Read-only diagnostics are not restricted.
